# NLP

The following repository is for the Natural Language Processing course which I am taking in the 5th sem of my Btech.

Runs on Python 2.7. The major code is written python, so that the repo can be downloaded and executed using the Command line. 

To do so, first clone the following repository onto your system

```
git clone "https://github.com/sahitpj/NLP.git"
```

Next move to the assignments directory 
```
cd assignments
```
Choose the assignment number you wish to see and move into the respective repository. Then execute the file you wish to run 
from the commmand line

```
python <filename>
```

There also exists a IPython book, which can be run too, on your Ipython console or Jupyter Notebook, however all findings
and calculations exist on that notebook itself.
